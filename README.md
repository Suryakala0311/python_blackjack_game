# python_blackjack_game
The Balckjack game program works by calculating total points.
The hand with the highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21; a hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust.
Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and the cards jack, queen, king are worth 10. So given 3 more 10's. The Ace is given 11 points.
Initially 2 cards will be given to the user and if the user further want to continue, one more card will be given to user and computer.
Then sum will be calculated for both user and computer and gives the results as who won the game.
